# Minigame_RollOrHold
Description: 
Two players compete against one another in a very basic version of the jeopardy dice game to see who can rack up 100 points first. During their turn, players take turns rolling a die multiple times until either a 1 is rolled or the player holdingÂ and scores the total of their previous rolls (i.e. the turn total). There are always two options available to a player throughout their turn: either to roll the die or to hold their hands.
